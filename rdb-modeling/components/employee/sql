sql : structured query language
language used to interact with rdmbs(관계형 db)

---
terminology



database : any collection of related information

dbms(database management system) : a special software that lets user create and maintain a database

rdbms(relational db management system) : helps users create/maintain relational db. ex) mySQL, Oracle, postgreSQL, mariaDB, etc.
they all use SQL.

CRUD : create/read/update/delete

relational db : organize data in one or more tables.

non-relational db(noSQL): key-value hash, json(or xml..), graph, etc. organize data in form of key-value hash/json/graph/etc...
ex) mongoDB, dynamoDB, apache cassandra, firebase, etc

query : query grep specific piece of info on complex tables on rdb



---
tables and keys



primary key : uniquely identifies specific row. two people can have exactly same name and other infos, but they still identified different b/c of primary key(i.e student_id)


2 types of primary key

surrogate key : artificial column of (mostly) number that has nothing to do with real world, but is there b/c we need primary key. surrogate key itselt isn't mapped to real world, so doesnt mean anything by itself. ex)emp_id

natural key : it has mapped to realworld, not just in db. ex)emp_ssn(employ social security number)


foreign key : attribute(column) in table A that will link us to another table B
FK stores PK of another table.
ex) branch_id, security_role

cool thing about FK1)
a table can have multiple FKs

cool thing about FK2)
FK can refer to another person in the same table
ex) emp_id 103 's FK:supervisor_id:100


composite key : when only 2 columns uniquely identifies each row
when column A can't uniquely identify the table(as a PK) 
AND column B can't also uniquely identify the table(as a PK).
BOTH have to stick TOGETHER to uniquely identify the table
ex) 
branch_id  supplier_name  supply_type

2           hammer_mill    paper
2           uni-ball       writing utensils
3           hammer_mill    paper
3           uni-ball       writing utensils

hammer_mill on branch number 2 only appears once.
hammer_mill on branch number 3 only appears once.

Core datatypes



INT	     : whole numbers
DECIMAL(M,N) : decimal numbers. M:total number of digits you want to store for this number. N: number of digits you want to store after decimals. 
VARCHAR(1)   : string of text of length 1. (variable character). maximum amount of character you want to store. 
BLOB         : binary large object. stores large data(images, files). 
DATE         : 'YYYY-MM-DD'
TIMESTAMP    : 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' used for when things happen(e.i when an item was purchased)

Create Table



//create
CREATE TABLE student (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(20),
    major VARCHAR(20)
);

//? - another way to set primary key on separate row

CREATE TABLE student (
    student_id INT,
    name VARCHAR(20),
    major VARCHAR(20),
    PRIMARY KEY(student_id)
);


//? - Contraints
데이터 입력할때 조건에 안맞으면 처음부터 안넣음
CREATE TABLE student (
    student_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT, //primary key일일히 1,2,3 적어주는게 아니라, 자동으로 +1씩 올려줌. 
//INSERT INTO student(name, major) VALUES('Kate','CS'); 하면 pk+1.


    name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, //NULL값 들어오면 에러
    address VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE, //'Gimpo'한명 들어왔으면, 다른사람 'Gimpo'못들어옴.
    major VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'undecided', //major가 비어있으면, undecided가기초값
    PRIMARY KEY(student_id)
);





---
Baisc CRUD


//delete
DROP TABLE student;


//add new column
ALTER TABLE student ADD gpa DECIMAL(3,2);


//delete column
ALTER TABLE student DROP COLUMN gpa;


//insert values
INSERT INTO student VALUES(1, 'Jack', 'Biology'); //make sure it's single quotation, not double quotations.

**warning
INSERT INTO student(student_id, name) VALUES(3, 'Claire');
INSERT INTO student(student_id, name) VALUES(3, 'Claire');
하면, PK가 겹쳐서 안되지만,

INSERT INTO student(student_id, name) VALUES(3, 'Claire');
INSERT INTO student(student_id, name) VALUES(4, 'Claire');
하면, 이름이 같아도 PK가 달라서 됨.


//insert values except for a few
INSERT INTO student(student_id, name) VALUES(2, 'Kate'); //you can still insert w/out major info. Kate gets NULL for major value.


//grep all info from table
SELECT * FROM student;


//show table meta-info
DESCRIBE student;


//update
UPDATE student
SET major = 'Bio'
WHERE major = 'Biology';


//use OR
UPDATE student
SET major = 'BioChem'
WHERE major = 'Bio' OR major = 'Chemestry'; //without where, SET applies to all rows







---
Basic Queries





SELECT name, major //student.name, student.major to be more clear. b/c you can use multiple tables that share the same column name
FROM student
ORDER BY name //alphabetical order. ASC, DESC
LIMIT 2; //only show 2 results



//Key words
<> : not
=  : equal
OR
AND
IN : contains
ex) SELECT * FROM student WHERE name IN ('Claire', 'Jack', 'Mike');

Union

= combines the results of multiple select statements into single column**



조건
1) 위에껀 2개, 밑에껀 한개 안됨. 무조건 1:1, 2:2, 3:3, ...
2) 한 column에 있는애들은 모두 같은 datatype이여야 함.




//Find an list of employee and branch names

SELECT employee.first_name, employee.last_name, branch.branch_name
FROM employee AND branch
은 여러개 columns에 나타내는데, 한 column에 나타내고 싶다면,



SELECT first_name AS Company_Names 
FROM employee //SELECT first, last 하면 error. 그럴땐 밑에 branch에도 branch_name, 딴거 있어야됨. 그래야 2 column이 완성되기 때문.
UNION
SELECT branch_name FROM branch

---
JOIN



combines two or more tables based on related columns between them



caution**
when you join two or more tables,
specify table names by doing,
employee.emp_id





//INNER JOIN : join if they **share the same** column



//Find all branches and the names of their managers

SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.first_name, branch.branch_name
FROM employee
JOIN branch
ON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id; //모든 employee가 select되는게 아니라, 이조건이 해당되는 애들만 불러들임 = 그래서 조건에 맞는 David, Michale, Josh만 딸려옴





//LEFT JOIN 

all tables from left table(FROM employee, not branch) will be included,
and branch table(right table) will be followed.


SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.first_name, branch.branch_name
FROM employee
LEFT JOIN branch
ON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id;


**David, Michael, Josh만 끌려오는게 아니라,
ON 조건에 안맞는 다른애들도 다 끌려옴. 
대신 branch_name없는 애들은 모두 NULL값 부여되서 딸려옴.






//RIGHT JOIN

all tables from right table(branch, not employee) will be included,
and employee table(left table) will be followed if condition matches.



SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.first_name, branch.branch_name
FROM employee
RIGHT JOIN branch
ON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id; 


-- console --
David,Michael,Josh,Null(for Buffalo) 
rest of employees are gone!





//FULL OUTTER JOIN

grep full left table + right table, no matter if they've met the condition or not

On Delete

employee에 Michael Scott을 지우면,
branch에 Scott의 매니저번호인 102는 아무짝에도 의미없는 데이터가 됨.
이걸 어떻게 처리?


1) On Delete Set Null
Michael Scott을 employee에서 지우면, branch에 mgr_id는 NULL이 됨.
또한 employee에서 Michael Scott의 emp_id를 FK한 super_id가 모두 NULL이 됨.

보통 mgr_id가 FK일때, 그다지 안중요할때 씀.


2) On Delete Cascade
Michael Scott을 employee에서 지우면, branch에 mgr_id 102번이 있는 row
전체를 지움.
branch에있는 branch_id가 지워지면, branch supplier에 branch_id가포함된 row전체 지움.

보통 branch_id가 PK고 쥰나 중요해서, PK가 날라가면 PK에 딸려있는게 아무 의미없을때 Delete On Cascade 씀

Triggers


defines certain action should happens,
when a certain event occurs.


conditions
you have to do on CLI
1) cmd : mysql -u root -p
2) mysql 8.0 command line client


use giraffe (name of database)


//1)


DELIMITER $$     //원래 delimiter은 ;이나, 저뒤에 insert values();에 한번 쓰기 때문에, $$로 임시로 바꾼다.

ER Diagrams Intro






Schema: database에 테이블들, 테이블들의 관계, 테이블에 데이터 놓을 때 주의해야할 데이터 타입 등의 집합체

ER Diagrams: schema에 필요한 테이블들의 관계를 그림으로 간단하게 표현한 것


ER: entity relations

Entity: an object we want to model & store information about. ex) student

Attributes: specific info about an entity.  ex) grade, name, gpa

Primary Key: an attribute that uniquely identify an entry in the database table

Composite Attribute: ex)name(first_name + last_name)

Multi-valued Attribute: an attribute that can have more than one value. ex)club

Derived Attribute: an attribute that can be derived from the other attributes.   ex)has_honors, derived from gpa

Multiple Entities: student, class entities

Relationships: defines a relationship between two entities
	1)Partial participation : expressed as single line. ex) student -> Class
		b/c not all students need to take a class
	2)Total participation : expressed as double line. ex) student <= Class
		b/c all the classes need to be taken by at least single student
		b/c a class with no student can't exist
	
	a)Relationship Attribute: ex) grade, student -> class. grade not stored 
		both in student obj nor class obj. 
	
	b)Relationship Cardinality
		N,M : any number. ex) student M-> class   b/c student can take multiple classes + not all student need to take a class
		      class N=> student    b/c class can take any number of students + a class needs at least one student.
		      Therefore, student:class' cardinal relationship is N:M
		1:1 - a student can take one class, and a class can take only one student.   ex)1대1과외
		1:N - a customer can buy multiple items, while an item can have only one purchaser. 


Weak Entity: an entity that can't be uniquely identified by its attributes alone. ex) exam entity. exam can't exist w/out class entity. 
	     weak entity 특징 : weak entity MUST have total participation to mother entity. ex) exam => class

Identifying relationship : a relationship that serves to uniquely identify weak entity.

Company Data Storage Requirements



The company is organized into branches. Each branch has a unique number, a name, and a particular employee who manages it.

The company makes it’s money by selling to clients. Each client has a name and a unique number to identify it.

The foundation of the company is it’s employees. Each employee has a name, birthday, sex, salary and a unique number.

An employee can work for one branch at a time, and each branch will be managed by one of the employees that work there. We’ll also want to keep track of when the current manager started as manager.

An employee can act as a supervisor for other employees at the branch, an employee may also act as the supervisor for employees at other branches. An employee can have at most one supervisor.

A branch may handle a number of clients, with each client having a name and a unique number to identify it. A single client may only be handled by one branch at a time.

Employees can work with clients controlled by their branch to sell them stuff. If nescessary multiple employees can work with the same client. We’ll want to keep track of how many dollars worth of stuff each employee sells to each client they work with.

Many branches will need to work with suppliers to buy inventory. For each supplier we’ll keep track of their name and the type of product they’re selling the branch. A single supplier may supply products to multiple branches.

ER Diagram -> Tables & Relations




step1) Mapping of Regular Entity Types.  ex) create branch, employee, client entities with attributes

step2) Mapping of weak entity type. ex) create branch supplier, with PK of composite key(supplier_name + branch_id)

step3) Mapping of Binary 1:1 Relationship types. ex) branch 1=-1 employee. branch가 total participation가지고 있기 때문에, employee의 emp_id(PK)를 FK삼아 branch에 줌. branch엔 employee의 emp_id가 mgr_id라는 새로운 컬럼으로 등장

step4) Mapping of Binary 1:N Relationship types. ex) branch 1-=N client. 1쪽인 branch의 pk를 client의 fk로. 그래서 client에 branch_id라는 새 column생김. 마찬가지로,
branch 1-=N employee. 에서 1side인 branch의 pk를 employee의 새 컬럼 branch_id만들어서 넣음. 

step5) Mapping of Binary N:M Relationship types. ex) client N=-M employee. N:M은 새 table을 만들어서 client.pk랑 employee.pk 합친 composite key를 pk로 만듬. 이걸 compound key임. 왜냐면 composite key인 2개가 모두 fk이기 때문.
