//trial01


select person_name, if(turn > 1, weight + (select weight from Queue as b where b.turn = a.turn-1), weight) as weight
from Queue as a
order by turn


누적으로 더하는걸 어케하지? reduce()같은게 mysql에 있나?


//solution1 by RamenNoddle

over()

with CTE as (select person_name, sum(weight) over(order by turn) as totalweight
from Queue
order by turn asc)

select person_name from CTE
where totalweight<=1000
order by totalweight desc limit 1


누적으로 더하는걸 처리하는 over()이라는 함수가 mysql에 있었다..
