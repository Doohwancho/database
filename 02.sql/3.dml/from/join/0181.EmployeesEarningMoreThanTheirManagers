solution1 - outer join
737ms

SELECT a.name as Employee
FROM Employee as a
LEFT JOIN Employee as b ON a.managerId = b.id
WHERE a.salary > b.salary



solution2 - inner join
680ms

SELECT a.name as Employee
FROM Employee as a
INNER JOIN Employee as b ON a.managerId = b.id
WHERE a.salary > b.salary



trial - 아 FROM table A, table B 해도 inner join 되는구나?
SELECT *
FROM Employee e1, Employee e2
WHERE e1.managerId = e2.id AND e1.salary > e2.salary;


solution3 - subquery
1102 ms - 아무래도 subquery가 join보단 느리지.
게다가 null check까지 해줘야 하니까 더 느리네.

select name as Employee
from Employee e
where salary > (select salary from Employee where id=e.managerId)
and e.managerId IS NOT NULL
