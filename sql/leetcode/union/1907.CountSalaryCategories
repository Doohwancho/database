# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT a.category, count(*) as accounts_count
FROM
(SELECT
    account_id,
    income,
    CASE
        WHEN income < 20000 THEN 'Low Salary'
        WHEN income > 50000 THEN 'High Salary'
        ELSE 'Average Salary'
    END AS category
FROM
    accounts
) as a
GROUP BY a.category
UNION
SELECT ?, 0 as accounts_count
FROM accounts



문제점

accounts_count가 0인 row를 만들 수 없었다.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT category, accounts_count
FROM
(SELECT 'Low Salary' AS category, count(case when income < 20000 then 1 end) AS accounts_count FROM accounts GROUP BY category) as a
UNION
(SELECT 'Average Salary' AS category, count(case when income >= 20000 and income <= 50000 then 1 end) AS accounts_count FROM accounts GROUP BY category)
UNION
(SELECT 'High Salary' AS category, count(case when income > 50000 then 1 end) AS accounts_count FROM accounts GROUP BY category)


어짜피 row가 3개니까, 각 row마다 가로로 값을 구하고 union으로 합치네

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT category, accounts_count
FROM
(SELECT 'Low Salary' AS category, count(case when income < 20000 then 1 end) AS accounts_count FROM accounts) as a
UNION
(SELECT 'Average Salary' AS category, count(case when income >= 20000 and income <= 50000 then 1 end) AS accounts_count FROM accounts)
UNION
(SELECT 'High Salary' AS category, count(case when income > 50000 then 1 end) AS accounts_count FROM accounts)

group by도 필요없다.
