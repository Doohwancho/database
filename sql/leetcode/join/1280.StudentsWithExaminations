//trial01

select s.student_id, s.student_name, e.subject_name, count(s.student_id) as attended_exams
from Students as s
    join Examinations as e on s.student_id = e.student_id
    left join Subjects as b on e.subject_name = b.subject_name
group by subject_name, student_id
order by student_id asc, subject_name asc


문제가 join할 때, Examinations 테이블에 없는게 null로 잡혀야 하는데, left outer join 써도 안잡힘.

왤까?

SELECT
    Students.student_id,
    Students.student_name,
    Subjects.subject_name,
    COUNT(Examinations.subject_name) AS attended_exams
FROM Students
JOIN Subjects
LEFT JOIN Examinations
ON Students.student_id = Examinations.student_id
AND Subjects.subject_name = Examinations.subject_name
GROUP BY Students.student_id, Subjects.subject_name



case1)

from a
join b on a.id = b.id
left join c on b.id = c.id

얘랑,

case2)

from a
join b
left join c
on a.id = b.id and b.id = c.id

얘랑 다르네? 왜지?

case1은 a,b 조인이 끝난 후에 c를 조인하는거고,
case2는 a,b,c를 동시에 조인하는거라서 다른건가?



cross join

select *
from Students as s
    cross join Subjects

이렇게 하면, 모든 subject에 대해 student를 붙임. 예를들어,

| student_id | student_name | subject_name |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| 2          | Bob          | Math         |
| 2          | Bob          | Physics      |
| 2          | Bob          | Programming  |

이렇게 나옴. 이 상태에서, Examinations 테이블을 left outer join하는데, 이 때, 조건을 student_id가 맞고 subject_name 까지 맞게끔 하는 것
